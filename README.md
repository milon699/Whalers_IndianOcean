# Whalers_IndianOcean
This repository contains code to proceed with data from historical climatological archives. The archives are ship logbooks from whale hunting activities in the 19th and 20th century taken from the New Bedford Whaling Museum in Massachusetts. In particular, the outcome for the Indian Ocean was analyzed with the aim to study the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and the characteristics of the Mascarene High (MH). However, as of now, the data still lacks continuity in that region, making it hard to produce climate indices. The project was supervised by Caroline Ummenhofer, PhD, senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.
